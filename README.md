# alx-pre_course
I'm now a ALX Student, this is my first repository as a full-stack engineer

## On my computer, I opened a terminal and do the following:

* And then i Navigated to your home directory. 
* next i Created a directory which says *alx-pre_course*.
* Navigate to this **new directory**.
* Initialize git and add the remote origin
* Create a file README.md with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small Markdown text to present this project.
* Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin 
[^1](Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)
